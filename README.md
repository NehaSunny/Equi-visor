python script can accept local files as input and output a visualiser in as directdraw output(i guess)
drawbacks:
can only accept local files
on display output
flask intergration support still at large
if somehow managed to get output as video (use ffmpeg maybe???) the process will be realtime ,ie. completion of output will take as long as the duration of input
